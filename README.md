pas2js: Convert Pascal to Javascript
====================================

Usage
-----

    pas2js < program.pas > program.js

The resulting `program.js` will be ill-formatted, so if you're planning on
editing it, you'll want to run it through a pretty-printer.

    pas2js < program.pas | closure --formatting PRETTY_PRINT > program.js

The resulting javascript file will be dependendent on `pascal.js` for
equivalents of various pascal functions.

Known Bugs
----------

 * Types aren't handled quite correctly. (Specifically, they are mostly
   ignored.)
